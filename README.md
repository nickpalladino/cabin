# Cabin

Cost comparision and CAD model for a Jamaica Cottage Shop cabin.

## Construction Methods

Post and Beam vs Studs

### Cutting

4x4's used in the post and beam constuction require a saw like a 12" Miter saw to cut with one cut vs a circular saw that would require multiple cuts. 2x4 stud construction could just use a circular saw.

## Lumber

Allowed cut optimizer to choose boards up to 20 ft which was the max length the sawmill offered. May want to constrain to shorter lengths to make material easier to handle. Would likely increase the cost a little.

## Building Code Considerations

The Jamaica Cottage Shop cabin is being considered for full-time residential use in upstate NY and therefore must meet applicable building codes.

### Load-supporting Lumber Certification

Sawn lumber utilized for load-supporting purposes must be identified by a grade mark [[2020 Residential Code of New York State (RCNYS)](https://dos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/09/2020-residential-code-of-new-york-state_compressed_0.pdf)], but lumber without a grade mark can be used if sold directly from mill to builder and mill certifies the lumber [[TB-1002-RCNYS](https://dos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2021/05/2020-06-11-tb-1002-grade-stamp_final.pdf)]. Need to check with local code enforcement and sawmill to be sure.
