# Cabin

Cost comparision and CAD model for a Jamaica Cottage Shop cabin.

## Construction Methods

Post and Beam vs Studs

### Cutting

4x4's used in the post and beam constuction require a saw like a 12" Miter saw to cut with one cut vs a circular saw that would require multiple cuts. 2x4 stud construction could just use a circular saw.

## Lumber

Allowed cut optimizer to choose boards up to 20 ft which was the max length the sawmill offered. May want to constrain to shorter lengths to make material easier to handle. Would likely increase the cost a little.
